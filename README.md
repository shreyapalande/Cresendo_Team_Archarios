## Smart Waste Classifier: Real-Time Trash Detection and Disposal Guidance

### Project Description:
This project leverages deep learning and real-time computer vision to classify waste items from live video streams and provide disposal recommendations. Using a custom-trained ResNet18 model with a dataset of over 20,000 labeled images across 13 waste categories (e.g., aluminum cans, batteries, biological waste, cardboard, plastic, etc.), the system achieves an 81% classification accuracy.

The system allows users to capture an image from a live video feed, which is then processed using a YOLO-based object detection model to locate and classify the waste item. Based on predefined disposal rules, the system suggests appropriate actions such as recycling, donation, composting (for food waste), or proper trash disposal. This AI-powered solution aims to promote sustainable waste management by providing real-time guidance on responsible waste disposal.
